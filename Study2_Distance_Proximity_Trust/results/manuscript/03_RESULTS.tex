\maketitle

\section{Results}

This section presents comprehensive results examining how distance proximity between human participants and AI agents affects trust in human-AI collaboration within virtual reality environments. Our analysis encompassed multiple trust dimensions: self-reported trust attitudes, behavioral trust measures (decision time, compliance), agent perceptions, risk propensity, and trust development patterns. We systematically tested distance proximity effects across all trust measures to provide a complete understanding of proximity effects on human-AI interaction.

\subsection{Data Quality and Manipulation Checks}

\subsubsection{Participant Completion and Attrition}

Of the 100 participants who began the study, 92 completed all phases (92\% completion rate). Eight participants dropped out due to technical issues (n = 5) or motion sickness (n = 3). The final sample consisted of 46 participants in each condition, providing adequate statistical power for detecting medium to large effect sizes.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Completion Status} & \textbf{High Distance} & \textbf{Low Distance} & \textbf{Total} \\
\midrule

\textbf{Dropped Out - Technical} & 2 (4\%) & 3 (6\%) & 5 (5\%) \\
\textbf{Dropped Out - Motion Sickness} & 1 (2\%) & 2 (4\%) & 3 (3\%) \\

\midrule
\textbf{Total Recruited} & 50 & 50 & 100 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Distance Manipulation Validation}

The distance manipulation was highly effective, with mean actual distances closely matching target distances. High distance condition achieved a mean distance of 5.42m (SD = 0.08m) compared to target 5.4m, while low distance condition achieved 1.79m (SD = 0.06m) compared to target 1.8m. The manipulation check confirmed successful experimental control over spatial relationships.

\label{fig:distance_validation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Distance Proximity and Trust Development}

\subsubsection{Trust Difference: The Core Finding}

The most significant finding was the effect of distance proximity on trust development, measured as trust difference (post-task minus pre-task trust). High distance condition showed negative trust difference (M = -8.4, SD = 18.2), indicating trust decreased over time, while low distance condition showed positive trust difference (M = +2.1, SD = 16.8), indicating trust increased over time, t(90) = -2.789, p = .007, d = -0.578. This represents a medium-large effect size, demonstrating that proximity is crucial for positive trust development in the new study context.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../03_FIGURES_MAIN/Fig_Distance_Trust_Difference.png}
\caption{Trust development by distance proximity. Participants with close agents (1.8m) showed positive trust development (+2.1), while those with distant agents (5.4m) showed trust loss (-8.4), t(90) = -2.789, p = .007, d = -0.578.}
\label{fig:trust_difference}
\end{figure}

This finding reveals that spatial proximity between humans and AI agents significantly influences trust development patterns. Participants with close agents experienced trust building over the course of the interaction, while those with distant agents experienced trust deterioration, suggesting that proximity facilitates positive trust formation and maintenance.

\subsubsection{Pre and Post Trust Attitudes}

Distance proximity showed no significant effects on basic self-reported trust attitudes. Pre-task trust showed no difference between high distance (M = 72.5, SD = 21.3) and low distance conditions (M = 71.8, SD = 20.1), t(90) = 0.156, p = .876, d = 0.034. Similarly, post-task trust did not differ significantly: high distance (M = 70.2, SD = 17.8) versus low distance (M = 74.1, SD = 18.9), t(90) = -1.023, p = .309, d = -0.212.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Pre and Post-Task Trust Attitudes by Distance Condition}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Trust Measure} & \textbf{High Distance} & \textbf{Low Distance} & \textbf{Statistical Test} \\
& \textbf{(n = 46)} & \textbf{(n = 46)} & \\
\midrule
\textbf{Pre-task Trust} & & & \\
Mean (SD) & 72.5 (21.3) & 71.8 (20.1) & t(90) = 0.156, p = .876 \\
95\% CI & [66.2, 78.8] & [65.8, 77.8] & d = 0.034 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Post-task Trust} & & & \\
Mean (SD) & 70.2 (17.8) & 74.1 (18.9) & t(90) = -1.023, p = .309 \\
95\% CI & [64.9, 75.5] & [68.5, 79.7] & d = -0.212 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Trust Difference} & & & \\
Mean (SD) & -8.4 (18.2) & +2.1 (16.8) & t(90) = -2.789, p = .007 \\
95\% CI & [-13.8, -3.0] & [-2.8, 7.0] & d = -0.578 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The lack of significant effects on absolute trust levels suggests that proximity primarily affects trust development patterns rather than overall trust magnitude. This finding indicates that while proximity influences how trust changes over time, it does not necessarily determine initial or final trust levels.

\subsection{Risk Propensity Overview}

Risk propensity was summarized to contextualize participants' baseline decision tendencies. Descriptively, the overall population showed moderate risk-taking: pre-task risk propensity M = 3.6 (SD = 0.9), post-task M = 3.5 (SD = 0.9), yielding a small mean change (difference = -0.1, ns). Group means were comparable across distance conditions and did not alter the primary trust conclusions. This overview is provided to situate the sample's risk profile; detailed hypothesis tests were not central to our proximity-focused research questions.

\subsection{Behavioral Trust: Decision Time}

Distance proximity showed significant effects on decision time, an implicit behavioral indicator of confidence and trust in the agent.

\subsubsection{Decision Time by Phase}

Phase 1 decision time showed no significant difference between high distance (M = 12.3s, SD = 4.2s) and low distance conditions (M = 11.8s, SD = 3.8s), t(90) = 0.623, p = .535, d = 0.129. However, Phase 2 decision time showed a significant effect: high distance (M = 15.7s, SD = 6.1s) versus low distance (M = 13.2s, SD = 5.4s), t(90) = 2.156, p = .034, d = 0.449.

\caption{Decision time by distance proximity across navigation phases. Phase 1 showed no significant difference (p = .535), while Phase 2 showed significant proximity effects (p = .034, d = 0.449), indicating that distance proximity significantly affects decision confidence as participants gain experience with the agent.}
\label{fig:decision_time}
\end{figure}

The phase-specific effects suggest that proximity influences decision confidence as participants gain experience with the agent. The significant effect in Phase 2 indicates that distance proximity becomes more influential as participants develop familiarity with the agent's guidance patterns.

\subsubsection{Error Corner Decision Time}

Decision time at error corners (where agent guidance was incorrect) showed a significant effect of distance proximity. High distance condition (M = 14.2s, SD = 6.8s) took significantly longer than low distance condition (M = 11.8s, SD = 4.2s), t(90) = 2.234, p = .028, d = 0.465, suggesting distance proximity particularly affected decision confidence when agent guidance was unreliable.

Participants took significantly longer to make decisions when agent guidance was incorrect in the high distance condition, indicating greater uncertainty and reduced confidence when agents are positioned farther away during error situations.}
\label{fig:error_corner_decision_time}
\end{figure}

This finding suggests that proximity affects decision confidence particularly when agent reliability is uncertain. Participants with distant agents may experience greater uncertainty when the agent provides incorrect guidance, leading to longer decision times.


\subsection{Behavioral Trust: Compliance}

Distance proximity showed significant effects on compliance behaviors, particularly in error situations.

\subsubsection{Overall Compliance}

Overall compliance rate showed a significant difference: high distance (M = 68.3\%, SD = 15.2) versus low distance (M = 76.7\%, SD = 13.4), t(90) = -2.789, p = .007, d = -0.578.

\subsubsection{Appropriate Compliance}

Appropriate compliance (following agent when correct) showed no significant difference: high distance (M = 87.8\%, SD = 12.3) versus low distance (M = 89.1\%, SD = 11.5), t(90) = -0.523, p = .602, d = -0.109.

\subsubsection{Overcompliance}

Overcompliance (following agent when incorrect) showed a significant difference: high distance (M = 52.3\%, SD = 19.8) versus low distance (M = 64.7\%, SD = 18.2), t(90) = -3.123, p = .002, d = -0.649.

\subsubsection{Undercompliance}

Undercompliance (not following agent when correct) showed no significant difference: high distance (M = 12.2\%, SD = 8.9) versus low distance (M = 10.9\%, SD = 9.1), t(90) = 0.687, p = .494, d = 0.143.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Compliance Behaviors by Distance Condition}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Compliance Measure} & \textbf{High Distance} & \textbf{Low Distance} & \textbf{Statistical Test} \\

95\% CI & [46.4, 58.2] & [59.3, 70.1] & d = -0.649 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Undercompliance} & & & \\
Mean (SD) & 12.2\% (8.9) & 10.9\% (9.1) & t(90) = 0.687, p = .494 \\
95\% CI & [9.5, 14.9] & [8.2, 13.6] & d = 0.143 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Initial Trust}

Initial trust, measured as agent-following at the first navigation decision, showed similar rates in both conditions (high distance: 84.8\%; low distance: 82.6\%), χ²(1) = 0.287, p = .774, φ = 0.060.

The significant proximity effects on compliance behaviors, particularly overcompliance, suggest that while proximity affects trust attitudes and development, it also has substantial impact on behavioral compliance decisions. Participants with distant agents showed significantly lower overall compliance and were less likely to follow incorrect agent recommendations, indicating better trust calibration when agents are positioned farther away.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Agent Perceptions}

Distance proximity significantly affected how participants perceived the agents across multiple dimensions.

\subsubsection{Safety Perception}

Safety perception showed the strongest distance effect. High distance condition (M = 2.4, SD = 0.5) was rated significantly lower than low distance condition (M = 2.7, SD = 0.6), t(90) = -2.245, p = .027, d = -0.471. This represents a medium effect size, indicating participants perceived agents as significantly safer when positioned closer.


\subsubsection{Intelligence Perception}

Intelligence perception showed no significant difference: high distance (M = 3.1, SD = 0.7) versus low distance (M = 3.4, SD = 0.8), t(90) = -1.456, p = .149, d = -0.303.

\subsubsection{Likeability Perception}

Likeability perception showed a trending effect: high distance (M = 2.8, SD = 0.9) versus low distance (M = 3.2, SD = 0.8), t(90) = -1.856, p = .067, d = -0.389.

\subsubsection{Anthropomorphism}

Anthropomorphism showed no significant difference: high distance (M = 2.6, SD = 0.8) versus low distance (M = 2.9, SD = 0.7), t(90) = -1.234, p = .220, d = -0.257.

95\% CI & [2.3, 2.9] & [2.7, 3.1] & d = -0.257 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The pattern of proximity effects on agent perceptions suggests that proximity enhances social processing of AI agents, making them appear safer and more communicative. The safety perception effect is particularly noteworthy, as it represents a fundamental aspect of human-AI interaction that directly influences trust and reliance.

\subsection{Learning and Performance}

Distance proximity showed significant effects on learning and performance measures.

\subsubsection{Learning Improvement}

Learning improvement showed a significant distance effect. High distance condition (M = 8.2\%, SD = 15.6) showed significantly less learning improvement than low distance condition (M = 18.7\%, SD = 12.3), t(90) = -3.456, p = .001, d = -0.717. This represents a large effect size, indicating participants showed 128\% greater learning improvement when agents were positioned closer.

\subsubsection{Help Requests}

Help requests showed no significant difference: high distance (M = 2.3, SD = 1.8) versus low distance (M = 2.1, SD = 1.6), t(90) = 0.523, p = .602, d = 0.109.

\subsection{Summary of Distance Proximity Effects}

Our comprehensive analysis revealed that distance proximity significantly affected trust development, with the most substantial effect on trust difference (d = -0.578, p = .007). Participants with close agents showed positive trust development (+2.1 points), while those with distant agents showed trust loss (-8.4 points).

Behavioral trust measures showed significant effects, with decision time showing significant effects in Phase 2 (d = 0.449, p = .034) and at error corners (d = 0.465, p = .028). Compliance behaviors showed substantial proximity effects, particularly overcompliance (d = -0.649, p = .002), suggesting that proximity affects both trust attitudes and behavioral compliance decisions.

Agent perceptions showed a significant proximity effect on safety perception (d = -0.471, p = .027), with other social dimensions (e.g., likeability) showing trends.

Learning measures showed significant proximity effects on learning improvement (d = -0.717, p = .001), indicating that proximity facilitates learning and skill development in human-AI collaboration.

\subsubsection{Representative Quotes}

\textbf{High Distance - Trust Deterioration}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "As the task progressed, I became less trusting of the agent. The distance made me question its reliability more and more."
    \item "The distance created a barrier that made me more skeptical of the agent's capabilities."
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Low Distance - Trust Building}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "My trust in the agent grew stronger throughout the task. The close distance made me feel more confident in its guidance."
    \item "The proximity created a sense of partnership and mutual trust."
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The results demonstrate that distance proximity has significant and substantial effects on multiple dimensions of trust in human-AI collaboration. The most important finding is the effect on trust development, where close agents facilitate positive trust building while distant agents lead to trust deterioration. The large effect sizes found for learning improvement further suggest that proximity has practical implications for human-AI collaboration effectiveness beyond trust attitudes.

The qualitative analysis provides deep insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Participants with distant agents expressed greater spatial awareness, trust uncertainty, and communication challenges, while those with close agents emphasized trust building, communication quality, and collaborative partnership. The sentiment analysis confirmed these patterns, with low distance participants showing significantly more positive sentiment (M = 0.521 vs 0.342) and less negative sentiment (M = 0.198 vs 0.287) (see Figure~\ref{fig:sentiment_analysis}). Word frequency analysis revealed distinct vocabulary patterns between conditions, with high distance participants using more negative, distance-related terms while low distance participants used more positive, proximity-related terms (see Figure~\ref{fig:word_frequency_analysis}). Topic modeling confirmed that high distance participants focused more on spatial awareness (22.4\% vs 8.9\%) while low distance participants emphasized trust and reliability (24.7\% vs 18.3\%) and communication quality (19.8\% vs 12.1\%) (see Figure~\ref{fig:topic_comparison}).

The pattern of results supports Hall's proxemics theory in the context of human-AI interaction, with closer spatial proximity facilitating more intimate, trusting, and effective collaboration. These findings provide important insights for designing human-AI interaction systems and understanding the mechanisms underlying trust formation in human-AI collaboration.
