\section{Research Design}

This study employed a between-subjects experimental design to examine how distance proximity between human participants and AI agents affects trust in human-AI collaboration within virtual reality environments. The research design was specifically tailored to test Hall's proxemics theory in the context of human-AI interaction, utilizing a remote VR paradigm that allowed for precise control over spatial relationships while maintaining ecological validity.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

\subsubsection{Design Overview}

The study employed a 2 × 1 between-subjects factorial design with distance proximity as the single independent variable. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Distance Condition}: AI agent positioned at 5.4 meters from the participant
    \item \textbf{Low Distance Condition}: AI agent positioned at 1.8 meters from the participant
\end{itemize}

The distance conditions were selected based on Hall's proxemics theory, specifically targeting the boundary between social (1.2-3.6m) and public (>3.6m) zones. The 1.8m distance represents the upper limit of the social zone, while the 5.4m distance represents the public zone, allowing for a clear distinction between intimate social interaction and distant formal interaction.

\subsubsection{Rationale for Distance Selection}

The selection of 1.8m and 5.4m distances was based on several theoretical and practical considerations:

\textbf{Proxemics Theory Foundation}: According to Hall's proxemics theory, the social zone (1.2-3.6m) is characterized by moderate intimacy and formal interaction, while the public zone (>3.6m) involves distant, formal interactions with lower intimacy and trust. The 1.8m distance represents the upper limit of comfortable social interaction, while the 5.4m distance represents a clear public zone interaction.

\textbf{VR Distance Perception}: Previous research has shown that users tend to underestimate distances in VR by approximately 50\% compared to real-world distances \citep{renner2013perceived}. Therefore, the 1.8m virtual distance would be perceived as approximately 0.9m (intimate zone), while the 5.4m virtual distance would be perceived as approximately 2.7m (social zone upper limit).

\textbf{Practical Considerations}: The distances were selected to ensure that participants could clearly perceive the spatial difference while maintaining task feasibility within the VR environment. The 5.4m distance was chosen to be sufficiently far to create a meaningful contrast while remaining within the practical limits of the VR space.

\subsection{Remote VR Study Paradigm}

\subsubsection{Study Context}

This study was conducted as a fully remote, online VR experiment, representing a novel approach to studying human-AI interaction in controlled spatial environments. The remote paradigm was chosen for several reasons:

\textbf{Ecological Validity}: Remote studies allow participants to engage with the VR environment in their own familiar space, potentially increasing ecological validity compared to laboratory studies.

\textbf{Accessibility}: Remote studies enable participation from diverse geographic locations and demographics, potentially increasing the generalizability of findings.

\textbf{Scalability}: Remote studies can accommodate larger sample sizes and more efficient data collection compared to traditional laboratory studies.

\textbf{COVID-19 Considerations}: The remote paradigm was particularly relevant given the global pandemic context, allowing for continued research while maintaining safety protocols.

\subsection{Sample Characteristics}

\subsubsection{Sample Size and Power Analysis}

A power analysis was conducted to determine the appropriate sample size for detecting medium effect sizes (d = 0.5) with 80\% power at α = .05. The analysis indicated that a minimum of 64 participants per condition (128 total) would be required. However, given the complexity of the remote VR study and potential attrition, a target sample size of 50 participants per condition (100 total) was set, with recruitment continuing until this target was met.

\textbf{Final Sample}: The study achieved a final sample of 92 participants (46 per condition), providing adequate power to detect medium to large effect sizes.

\section{Conclusion}

This research design represents a comprehensive approach to studying distance proximity effects on trust in human-AI collaboration. The remote VR paradigm enables precise control over spatial relationships while maintaining ecological validity, providing a novel methodology for investigating proxemics theory in human-AI interaction.

The study design addresses several important gaps in the literature, including the lack of systematic investigation of spatial factors in human-AI interaction and the need for scalable methodologies for VR research. The comprehensive data collection approach ensures robust analysis of multiple trust dimensions, while the rigorous experimental design maintains internal validity despite the remote nature of the study.

The expected findings will contribute significantly to our understanding of trust formation mechanisms in human-AI interaction and provide practical guidance for designing effective human-AI collaboration systems. The methodological innovations developed for this study will also provide a foundation for future research on spatial factors in human-AI interaction and remote VR research methodologies.
