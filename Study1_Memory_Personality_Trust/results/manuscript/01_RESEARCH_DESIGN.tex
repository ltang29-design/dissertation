\section{Study Design Overview}

This study employed a 2 (Agent Memory Function: +MAPK vs. $-$MAPK) $\times$ 2 (Agent Personality: Introvert vs. Extrovert) between-subjects factorial design to investigate how agent memory capabilities and personality characteristics influence human trust calibration in human-AI collaboration. The study was conducted \textbf{entirely online} using a remote VR paradigm, allowing participants to complete the experiment in their own homes using their personal Oculus Quest 2 headsets.

\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{RQ1}: Does agent memory function (+MAPK vs. $-$MAPK) affect trust calibration in human-AI teams?
    \item \textbf{RQ2}: Does agent personality (Introvert vs. Extrovert) influence trust formation and maintenance?
    \item \textbf{RQ3}: Does personality matching (congruence between human and agent personality) moderate trust dynamics?
    \item \textbf{RQ4}: How do these factors interact to shape behavioral trust compliance patterns?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Conditions}

Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions:

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../03_FIGURES_MAIN/Fig_Experimental_Design.png}
\caption{2 × 2 Factorial Experimental Design showing the four conditions combining agent memory function (±MAPK) and agent personality (Introvert vs. Extrovert). Each condition contained 23 participants (N = 92 total). The design allows examination of main effects of memory function and agent personality, as well as their interaction effects on trust calibration.}
\label{fig:experimental_design}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{2 $\times$ 2 Factorial Design Conditions}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
& \textbf{Introvert Agent} & \textbf{Extrovert Agent} \\
\midrule
\textbf{+MAPK (With Memory)} & Condition 1 (\textit{n} = 23) & Condition 2 (\textit{n} = 23) \\
\textbf{$-$MAPK (Without Memory)} & Condition 3 (\textit{n} = 23) & Condition 4 (\textit{n} = 23) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Target sample size}: \textit{N} = 92 (23 participants per cell)

\textbf{Power analysis}: Based on pilot testing (\textit{n} = 12), medium effect sizes ($f$ = 0.25, $d$ = 0.50) for memory and personality effects were anticipated. With \textit{n} = 23 per cell, power = 0.80 for detecting medium effects at $\alpha$ = .05.

\section{Participant Recruitment}

\subsection{Recruitment Platform: Prolific}

Participants were recruited through \textbf{Prolific} (https://www.prolific.co), an online research participant platform. Unlike typical online studies, this study required participants to have specialized equipment and VR expertise.

\subsection{Eligibility Criteria}

Prolific's pre-screening system filtered participants based on strict VR-related requirements:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Participant Eligibility Criteria}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.35\textwidth}p{0.55\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Requirement} \\
\midrule
\textbf{VR Equipment Ownership} & Must own an \textbf{Oculus Quest 2} headset \\
\midrule
\textbf{VR Experience Level} & Must play VR games/applications \textbf{at least 3 times per week} \\
\midrule
\textbf{VR Familiarity} & Self-reported VR proficiency $\geq$ 7/10 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Technical Capability} & Able to install APK files on Quest 2 (sideloading experience preferred) \\
\midrule
Age & 18 years or older \\
\midrule
Fluency & English fluency (self-reported 8/10 or higher) \\
\midrule
Vision & Normal or corrected-to-normal vision (compatible with VR headset use) \\
\midrule
Geographic location & United States or United Kingdom \\
\midrule
Approval rate & $\geq$ 95\% approval rate on previous Prolific studies \\
\midrule
Device access & Access to computer for online pre/post surveys \\
\midrule
Availability & Available to complete study within 7 days of acceptance \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Rationale for VR expertise requirement}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimized learning effects and VR sickness
    \item Enabled focus on trust dynamics rather than VR adaptation
    \item Ensured participants could complete task independently without technical support
    \item Reduced attrition due to VR discomfort or technical difficulties
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compensation Structure}

\subsubsection{Base Compensation}

All participants received \textbf{\$25 USD} base compensation for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre-study online survey (10--15 minutes)
    \item Downloading and installing VR application (5--10 minutes)
    \item Completing VR navigation task (30--45 minutes)
    \item Post-task online surveys (20--30 minutes)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total time commitment}: 1.5--2 hours

\textbf{Hourly rate}: \$25 for 1.5--2 hours = \$12.50--\$16.67/hour (exceeds Prolific minimum wage standards of \$12/hour USD)

\subsubsection{Performance Bonus Incentive}

To encourage genuine task engagement and efficient decision-making, a \textbf{performance bonus} was offered:

\textbf{Top 1\% performer}: Additional \textbf{\$5 bonus} (\$30 total compensation)

\textbf{Performance criteria}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Task completion time (faster completion preferred)
    \item Decision accuracy (choosing correct paths)
    \item Minimal backtracking (fewer errors)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance calculation}:
\begin{equation}
\text{Performance Score} = 0.50 \times \text{Accuracy} + 0.30 \times (1 - \text{Normalized Time}) + 0.20 \times (1 - \text{Normalized Backtracks})
\end{equation}

\textbf{Top 1\% threshold}: The single participant (\textit{n} = 1 out of 92) with the highest performance score received the \$5 bonus.

\textbf{Transparency}: Participants were informed of the bonus structure in the informed consent but were not shown real-time performance scores during the task to prevent interference with natural trust calibration.

\subsection{Sample Demographics}

Final sample (\textit{N} = 92) demographics:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Sample Demographics}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Characteristic} & \textbf{Count / M (SD)} & \textbf{Percentage / Range} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Age} & 28.4 (7.2) & 18--54 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Gender} & & \\
\quad Female & 47 & 51.1\% \\
\quad Male & 43 & 46.7\% \\
\quad Non-binary & 2 & 2.2\% \\
\midrule
\textbf{Education} & & \\
\quad High school & 8 & 8.7\% \\
\quad Some college & 15 & 16.3\% \\
\quad Bachelor's degree & 52 & 56.5\% \\
\quad Graduate degree & 17 & 18.5\% \\
\midrule
\textbf{VR Experience (Years)} & 2.8 (1.4) & 0.5--7 \\
\midrule
\textbf{VR Usage Frequency} & & \\
\quad 3 times/week & 38 & 41.3\% \\
\quad 4--5 times/week & 32 & 34.8\% \\
\quad Daily & 22 & 23.9\% \\
\midrule
\textbf{Personality (BFI Extraversion)} & 3.24 (0.68) & 1.50--4.88 \\
\quad Introverts (BFI $<$ 3.0) & 38 & 41.3\% \\
\quad Extroverts (BFI $\geq$ 3.0) & 54 & 58.7\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Random Assignment Procedure}

\subsection{Randomization Strategy}

\textbf{Randomization method}: Block randomization with equal distribution

\textbf{Randomization software}: Qualtrics randomizer

\subsubsection{Block Randomization Implementation}

\textbf{Block size}: 4 participants per block

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participants completed informed consent and pre-screening
    \item Upon meeting all eligibility criteria, Qualtrics randomizer assigned participant to 1 of 4 conditions
    \item Assignment was balanced using block randomization (every 4 participants included exactly 1 per condition)
    \item Condition assignment determined which APK version participant received
    \item 23 complete blocks ($23 \times 4 = 92$ total participants)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Participant blinding}: Participants were \textbf{not informed} of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The existence of multiple experimental conditions
    \item Which condition they were assigned to
    \item The specific experimental manipulations (memory function, personality type)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Participants were told}: ``You will work with an AI agent to navigate a virtual maze. The agent will provide guidance to help you find the correct path.''

\section{Study Procedure}

\subsection{Overview of Remote VR Paradigm}

This study employed a \textbf{fully remote data collection paradigm}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Participants completed the study \textbf{at home} using their personal Oculus Quest 2 headsets
    \item VR application delivered as \textbf{APK file} (Android application package)
    \item No in-person lab visits required
    \item Self-paced completion within 7-day window
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages of remote VR approach}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ecological validity}: Participants interacted with VR in natural home environment
    \item \textbf{Geographic diversity}: No geographic constraints (US/UK recruitment)
    \item \textbf{Participant comfort}: Familiar equipment and environment reduced anxiety
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Enabled larger sample collection without lab space constraints
    \item \textbf{Cost-effectiveness}: No equipment procurement or lab space rental needed
\end{enumerate}

    \item Application launches, displays welcome screen
    \item Participant confirms they are ready to begin
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 10: In-App Tutorial (5 minutes)}

Before main task, participants complete brief tutorial:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to controls (movement, turning, decision-making)
    \item Practice navigation in simple 3-corner tutorial maze
    \item No AI agent in tutorial (prevents confounding pre-task exposure)
    \item Must complete tutorial successfully to proceed to main task
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 11: Main VR Navigation Task (30--45 minutes)}

\textbf{Phase 1: Forward Navigation (Corners 1--5)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AI agent appears and introduces itself (personality-specific dialogue)
    \item Participant navigates through 5 decision points
    \item Agent provides directional recommendations at each corner
    \item Agent accuracy: 80\% (4 correct, 1 error at Corner 3)
    \item Agent acknowledges error after backtrack
    \item Duration: 12--18 minutes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Transition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item On-screen message: ``Excellent progress! You've reached the halfway point. Now navigate back to the starting point where the EXIT is located.''
    \item Agent provides transition dialogue (personality-specific)
    \item Brief pause (5 seconds) before Phase 2 begins
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: Return Navigation (Corners 6--10)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Participant navigates back through 5 new decision points
    \item \textbf{Memory Manipulation Active}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{+MAPK conditions}: Agent makes 5--7 memory references (``I remember that lamp,'' ``We came through here earlier'')
        \item \textbf{$-$MAPK conditions}: Agent provides same recommendations without memory references
    \end{itemize}
    \item Agent accuracy: 60\% (3 correct, 2 errors at Corners 7 and 9)
    \item Agent acknowledges each error after backtrack
    \item Duration: 15--22 minutes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Task Completion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Participant reaches EXIT
    \item Success message displayed: ``Congratulations! You have completed the navigation task.''
    \item Agent provides closing dialogue (personality-specific)
    \item \textbf{Completion code displayed} on large virtual screen (8-digit code)
    \item Instruction: ``Please write down this code and return to the online survey.''
    \item Code displayed for 30 seconds, then application closes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Automated Data Collection}

Throughout task, application automatically logged:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All decision times (millisecond precision)
    \item All decision choices (Left/Right/Forward)
    \item Help request usage (count and timing)
    \item Backtrack events
    \item Total task duration
    \item Participant ID (for data matching)
    \item Condition assignment (for verification)
    \item Device information (Quest 2 model, Android version)
    \item Session timestamp
\end{itemize}

Data automatically uploaded to secure server upon task completion (encrypted transmission).

\subsubsection{Phase 4: Post-Task Survey (Days 3--9)}

\textbf{Step 12: Automatic Redirect to Qualtrics}

After noting completion code, participants:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Receive email reminder: ``You've completed the VR task! Please complete the final survey.''
    \item Click link to Qualtrics post-task survey
    \item Enter completion code to verify task completion
    \item Code must match server-logged code (prevents fraud)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 13: Post-Task Survey (20--30 minutes)}

Survey includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Trust Measures}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trust\_post: ``How much did you trust the AI agent's recommendations?'' (1--7)
        \item Trust\_difference: Calculated as Trust\_post $-$ Trust\_pre
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Agent Perception Scales} (7-point Likert):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intelligence (3 items): ``The agent seemed intelligent''
        \item Competence (3 items): ``The agent was competent at navigation''
        \item Animacy (3 items): ``The agent seemed lifelike''
        \item Likeability (3 items): ``I liked the agent''
        \item Anthropomorphism (5 items): ``The agent seemed human-like''
        \item Safety (3 items): ``I felt safe following the agent''
        \item Trustworthiness (4 items): ``The agent was trustworthy''
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Decision Confidence}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each of 10 corners: ``How confident were you in your decision at Corner X?'' (1--5)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Open-Ended Questions}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ``Describe your overall experience working with the AI agent during the navigation task.''
        \item ``How did you decide whether to follow or ignore the agent's recommendations?''
        \item ``Did you notice anything distinctive about the agent's communication style or behavior? If so, what?''
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Manipulation Checks}:

\section{Agent Guidance Specifications}

\subsection{Decision Points and Agent Accuracy}

The agent provided recommendations at 10 decision points with intentional errors to assess trust calibration:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Agent Recommendations and Accuracy by Corner}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Corner} & \textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Correct Path} & \textbf{Agent Rec.} & \textbf{Accuracy} \\
\midrule
1 & 1 & Right & Right & Correct \\
2 & 1 & Forward & Forward & Correct \\
3 & 1 & Right & Left & \textbf{ERROR} \\
4 & 1 & Right & Right & Correct \\
5 & 1 & Forward & Forward & Correct \\
\midrule
6 & 2 & Forward & Forward & Correct \\
7 & 2 & Left & Forward & \textbf{ERROR} \\
8 & 2 & Left & Left & Correct \\
9 & 2 & Forward & Left & \textbf{ERROR} \\
10 & 2 & Left & Left & Correct \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Summary}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overall Agent Accuracy}: 70\% (7 correct out of 10)

\section{Data Quality Control}

\subsection{Exclusion Criteria}

Data excluded if:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participant withdrew consent during or after study (\textit{n} = 0)
    \item Technical failure prevented task completion (\textit{n} = 2, replaced)
    \item Completion code mismatch (potential fraud) (\textit{n} = 0)
    \item Completion time $>$ 90 minutes (potential disengagement) (\textit{n} = 1, replaced)
    \item Incomplete post-task survey (\textit{n} = 3, replaced)
    \item Straight-line responding on surveys (SD $<$ 0.5) (\textit{n} = 2, replaced)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Total exclusions}: 8 participants excluded and replaced to achieve final \textit{N} = 92

\subsection{Attention Checks}

\textbf{In VR task}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decision time $>$ 60s flagged for review
    \item Excessive help usage (all 5 at multiple corners) flagged
\end{itemize}

\textbf{In post-task survey}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 attention check items: ``Please select 'Strongly Agree' for this item''
    \item All final participants (\textit{N} = 92) passed both checks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Manipulation Checks}

Post-task survey included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory check}: ``Did the agent reference previous events or landmarks?''
    \begin{itemize}
        \item +MAPK: 91.3\% correctly identified memory references
        \item $-$MAPK: 8.7\% incorrectly perceived memory references (acceptable false positive rate)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Personality check}: ``How would you describe the agent's personality?'' (1--7: Introverted--Extroverted)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introvert conditions: \textit{M} = 2.8, \textit{SD} = 1.1
        \item Extrovert conditions: \textit{M} = 5.6, \textit{SD} = 0.9
        \item \textit{t}(90) = 13.2, \textit{p} $<$ .001, \textit{d} = 2.77 (large effect, successful manipulation)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Ethical Considerations}

\subsection{IRB Approval}

Study approved by [Institution] Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol \#XXXX-XXXX).

All participants provided electronic informed consent before participation, including full disclosure of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Study purpose, procedures, time commitment
    \item Compensation structure
    \item Minimal risks (mild VR discomfort)
    \item Data confidentiality and privacy protections
    \item Right to withdraw at any time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deception and Debriefing}

\textbf{Deception}: Participants not informed of experimental manipulations before completion (to prevent demand characteristics).

\textbf{Debriefing}: Full debriefing provided immediately after post-task survey, explaining manipulations and offering data withdrawal option (no participants withdrew).

\subsection{Data Protection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All data encrypted during storage and transmission
    \item Participant IDs anonymized (P001--P092)
    \item No personal information linked to research data
    \item Prolific IDs stored separately from behavioral data
    \item Data accessible only to research team
    \item 7-year retention per institutional policy
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}

This study employed a fully remote VR paradigm to investigate agent memory and personality effects on human trust calibration. Through online recruitment of VR-experienced participants (\textit{N} = 92 via Prolific), condition-specific APK distribution, self-administered VR navigation task completion, and comprehensive online surveys, we obtained high-quality behavioral and self-report data while maximizing ecological validity and scalability.
