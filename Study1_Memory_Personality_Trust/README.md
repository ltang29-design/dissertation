# Study 1: Memory Function and Personality Matching Effects on Trust

## Overview

This study investigates how memory function and personality matching between humans and AI agents influence trust development in collaborative virtual reality environments. We examine the effects of memory assistance and agent personality (extrovert vs. introvert) on multiple dimensions of trust, including self-reported attitudes, behavioral compliance, decision-making patterns, and learning outcomes.

## Research Questions

1. **Memory Function Effects**: How does memory assistance influence trust development and behavioral compliance?
2. **Personality Matching Effects**: How does matching/mismatching human and agent personalities affect trust and collaboration?
3. **Interaction Effects**: Do memory function and personality matching interact to influence trust outcomes?
4. **Trust Development Patterns**: How do trust attitudes change over the course of interaction?

## Experimental Design

- **Design**: 2 Ã— 2 between-subjects factorial design
- **Factors**: 
  - Memory Function: With Memory vs. Without Memory
  - Agent Personality: Extrovert vs. Introvert
- **Sample Size**: 92 participants (23 per condition)
- **Task**: VR maze navigation with AI agent guidance
- **Duration**: ~60 minutes per session

## Key Findings

### Memory Function Effects
- **Trust Development**: Memory function significantly affects trust change over time
- **Decision Time**: Participants with memory assistance show different decision patterns
- **Learning**: Memory function influences learning curves and improvement
- **Compliance**: Memory affects behavioral compliance with agent recommendations

### Personality Matching Effects
- **Agent Perceptions**: Personality matching influences likeability and intelligence ratings
- **Trust Attitudes**: Matching affects pre-task and post-task trust levels
- **Compliance Behaviors**: Personality matching influences compliance patterns
- **Decision Making**: Matching affects decision confidence and timing

### Trust Development Patterns
- **Phase Differences**: Trust development varies across navigation phases
- **Learning Curves**: Trust patterns change as participants gain experience
- **Error Handling**: Trust responses to agent errors vary by condition
