## üéì FOR YOUR PAPER - ADVANCED NLP SECTION

### **Recommended Addition to Methods**:

> "**Advanced Text Analysis**: Open-ended responses were analyzed using five complementary methods: (1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for probabilistic topic modeling, (2) Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for interpretable theme extraction, (3) n-gram analysis (bigrams and trigrams) for natural language patterns, (4) co-occurrence network analysis for semantic relationships (5-word windows), and (5) k-means semantic clustering using TF-IDF representations. All analyses used custom stop word lists to remove domain-general terms while preserving conceptually meaningful words."

> "**Advanced Text Mining Results**:
>
> **Topic modeling revealed condition-specific meaning-making frameworks.** For trustworthiness perceptions (Q5), memory function significantly altered topic distribution (œá¬≤(2) = 8.955, p = .011): participants with memory focused more on competence/performance (42.5% vs 22.7%), while those without memory emphasized error acknowledgment (47.7% vs 17.5%). This suggests different conditions created qualitatively distinct trustworthiness criteria.
>
> **Semantic clustering identified a highly condition-specific response style** for memory trust effects (Q3): 81.8% of responses in the "memory verification" cluster came from +MAPK participants (9/11), featuring language about comparing, questioning, and checking agent suggestions against own memory. This verification strategy was nearly absent in -MAPK responses, demonstrating memory function created an entirely new cognitive approach to trust evaluation, not merely performance differences.
>
> **N-gram analysis uncovered embodied trust metaphors unique to VR navigation.** The phrase "dead end" appeared 10 times as both literal description and metaphorical trust violation (e.g., "trust went to a dead end"), suggesting physical navigation failures directly shaped conceptual trust representations. Additionally, "hesitant trust" emerged as a distinct construct (6 occurrences), indicating trust has a certainty dimension separate from level‚Äîparticipants could maintain trust while feeling hesitant, challenging binary trust models.
>
> **Co-occurrence network analysis revealed error centrality in trust cognition.** The strongest semantic association was between "trust" and "wrong" (11 co-occurrences within 5-word windows), forming a conceptual triangle with "hesitant" (7 co-occurrences). Low-trust participants showed 52.2% concentration in error-focused topics compared to distributed patterns in high-trust participants (œá¬≤(2) = trend), suggesting **low trust creates cognitive coherence around errors while high trust reflects diverse positive experiences**.
>
> **Multiple trust-building philosophies coexist.** Cluster analysis identified equal prevalence of competence-based trust ("seemed confident", 40.5%) and honesty-based trust ("willing admit [mistakes]", 40.5%), demonstrating **two distinct pathways to trustworthiness**: appearing capable versus transparently acknowledging limitations. This finding has important design implications‚Äîagents need not be perfect if honest about uncertainties."
