## 🎯 YOUR PAPER STORY

### **Main Message**:
> "Memory function and agent personality significantly affect human-agent interaction in VR navigation. Memory augmentation created substantial cognitive load that reversed learning curves (d = 1.78-2.45), while agent personality had phase-specific effects on decision times (p = 0.007) and conditional effects on trust. Trust development required manageable cognitive demands (E-MAPK optimal). Personality matching affected trust calibration rather than trust levels, and influenced qualitative engagement depth rather than quantitative trust magnitude."

### **4 Major Theoretical Contributions**:

1. **Memory augmentation can impair learning** (counterintuitive)
   - Very large effects (d = 2.45)
   - Learning curves reversed
   - Selective Phase 2 impairment

2. **Phase-specific agent effects**
   - Introvert advantage in Phase 1 only
   - Different factors matter at different stages

3. **Optimal trust conditions identified**
   - E-MAPK (extrovert + no memory) best for trust
   - Cognitive load overshadows personality

4. **Trust calibration vs trust level distinction**
   - Match affects accuracy (calibration), not magnitude (level)
   - Novel methodological insight

## 🎓 LIMITATIONS TO ACKNOWLEDGE

1. **High baseline trust** (ceiling effect for trust manipulation)
2. **Personality matching not perceived** (similarity ratings n.s.)
3. **Help system underutilized** (M = 0.00 uses)
4. **Subgroup sample sizes** (some n = 19-26)

### **How to Frame**:
> "Several limitations should be noted. First, baseline trust was high (~70 pre-task, ~85% initial compliance), potentially creating ceiling effects that limited trust increase. Second, personality matching may not have been sufficiently salient, as participants did not report perceiving similarity differences (p = 0.387). Third, the help system was not used by any participant in our sample, preventing analysis of reliance patterns as originally planned. Fourth, subgroup sample sizes (n = 19-26) were adequate for detecting large effects but may have missed smaller effects. Despite these limitations, robust large-to-very-large effect sizes for decision-making outcomes (d = 0.84-2.45) demonstrate meaningful and replicable experimental effects."
